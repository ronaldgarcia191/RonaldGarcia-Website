        <p class="lead mb-4">Looking back nothing was more impactful than my high school years. That's because of events between my freshman year and now, that had a very profound impact on where I want to go in the future. I have completed AP classes, received numerous awards, received above average grades, and have reached many achievements, which have astonished my family and has pushed me to excel in any environment I am placed into and to learn from the difficulties and overcome them rather than struggle from them. This concept I have always held, and it makes the most of situations and this allows me to be optimistic in any situation and overcome the task at hand.<br><br>

        My family plays a big role in my development, as a family should, but I feel as if they have taught me more. I am the youngest of the family, and that they have relapsed on mistakes of their own and mistakes with my older siblings and molded a new guide to how they would raise me. The impact of that has honestly led me here, they strive for a great future for me and I strive for that too. Between my family and school, they both helped develop skills like motivation, persistence, maturity, resourceful, and sociability. From school, my skills include dependable, disciplined, leadership, nonconformist, a fast learner, and a researcher. Throughout my academics, my classes: I have a total of 7 AP classes under my belt, I was a part of multiple clubs like: Captain of the Academic Decathlon Team, Science Club, and UNICEF. Stepping away from my high school years, my hobbies have remained consistent, I consider myself to be an outdoorsman, I enjoy time fishing, hiking, and vacation to places like Mammoth, CA or traveling throughout California and visiting all the state and national parks. I enjoy observations the natural geology of the Earth and the abundant wildlife that calls California its home. Which this love for the outdoors has furthered my passion for the wanting to major into a field that would represent these areas while still developing my knowledge of the government. Which led me to choose a career in Political Science and Administrative Studies.<br><br>

        Growing up in the suburbs of Southern California a lot has happened in the past 18 years; from environmental to development to an ever-growing city landscape. With so much happening I grew a passion to help further that change throughout the country and the region I grew up in. Which has sparked my passion in government and politics. Since the start of 2015 I have grown interest into the history and founding of our country and also how our system of government works through the works of the Constitution. Therefore, I strive to promote good government ethics and help create a more functional and well-working government both local and state level. Now attending and pursuing this goal of mine, I hope to bring about as much change as I can to any area I see myself in.
